these distributions, and obtain constraints on both cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Both colour distributions and

1 INTRODUCTION
Machine learning methods, particularly deep learning algorithms,
are now capable of learning both deterministic and probabilistic re-
lationships with a high degree of flexibility, and have achieved wide
use within the fields of cosmology and astrophysics (Carleo et al.
2019;?; Smith & Geach 2023). One particularly powerful applica-

observed data ( e.g.Christensen et al. 2001). This combination of
machine learning and Bayesian inference is known as Simulation
Based Inference (SBI, also called implicit likelihood inference, or
likelihood-freeinference;seeMarinetal.2012;Cranmeretal.2020),
a rigorous Bayesian approach to learning the relationship between
simulated data ( X) and the underlying parameters used to generate
it (ùúÉ), typically leveraging flexible neural density estimators (NDEs,
¬©2024 The AuthorsarXiv:2411.13960v1  [astro-ph.GA]  21 Nov 20242 C. C. Lovell et al.
e.g. Durkan et al. 2019). In contrast with traditional Bayesian meth-
ods,ananalyticformofthelikelihooddoesnotneedtobeprovided;
instead, an SBI approach directly learns the form of the likelihood.
This provides many advantages, particularly in instances where the
likelihoodisnon-Gaussian(suchaswhensystematicsareconsidered;
Jeffrey et al. 2021), or intractable (such as in field‚Äìlevel inference;
Leclercq & Heavens 2021; Lemos et al. 2023). They also permit
amortizedinference,wherebythefullposteriorcanbeevaluatedand

cost;thisopensupnewavenuesforBayesianparameterinferenceon
extremely large datasets (Ho et al. 2024).
A number of studies have used SBI to perform cosmological pa-
rameter inference. These exploit simulations that explicitly model
the relationship between cosmological parameters and observable
statistics, such as the cosmic microwave background power spec-
trum(e.g.Lemosetal.2023),orclusteringstatisticsinthepresence
of weak-lensing effects (e.g. von Wietersheim-Kramsta et al. 2024).

2021; Tessore et al. 2023) to full ùëÅ-body simulations of the large

Thesesimulationsself-consistentlymodeltheevolutionofcollision-

beyond which subgrid models are used to approximate the impact
of sub-resolution physical processes on the macro-scale properties
of galaxies. Such simulations can be used in an SBI framework not

directly on astrophysical parameters of interest. However, hydrody-

Despitetheseobstaclestherehasbeenrecentprogressinproducing

The Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE-Learning Simula-
tions (CAMELS; Villaescusa-Navarro et al. 2021b) project brought
together a number of hydrodynamic and semi-analytic galaxy for-
mation models, each consisting of large suites of simulations vary-
ing both cosmological and astrophysical paramaters that have been
usedinanSBIframeworkforparameterinference( e.g.Villaescusa-
Navarro et al. 2021a, 2022; Nicola et al. 2022; Hassan et al. 2022;
Friedman&Hassan2022;Thieleetal.2022;Villanueva-Domingo&
Villaescusa-Navarro 2022; Shao et al. 2022; de Santi et al. 2023b,a;
Perez et al. 2023; Jo et al. 2023; Echeverri-Rojas et al. 2023).The majority of these studies have performed inference on intrin-
sic properties of galaxies (or physical fields). However, in order to
make a like-for-like comparison with observations we must forward
model theelectromagnetic emission fromgalaxies, andcompare di-
rectlyinthisobserverspace(Fortunietal.2023).Thereareanumber
of approaches for achieving this, but almost all start by modelling
the stellar emission using stellar population synthesis (SPS) models
(Conroy 2013) coupled to the star formation and metal enrichment
history of each simulated galaxy. Many also account for line and
continuumemissionfromyoungnebularregions,utilisingphotoion-
isation codes such as Mappings andCloudy(Dopita & Sutherland
1996;Chatzikosetal.2023).Oneofthemostimportantgalaxycom-
ponentsthathasanoutsizedimpactontheobservedspectralenbergy
distribution (SED) is cosmic dust, which leads to attenuation in the
UV‚Äìoptical, and thermal emission in the infrared (Calzetti 2001;
Draine 2003). There are a number of methods for modelling this
attenuation and emission, from simple analytic models (Charlot &
Fall 2000) to full dust radiative transfer approaches (Camps & Baes
2015; Narayanan et al. 2021).
Itisclearfromthesevariousingredientsintheforwardmodelthat

model can have a large impact on the predicted intrinsic emission,
particularly if the impact of binaries is taken into account (Wilkins
etal.2016;Stanwayetal.2016;Eldridgeetal.2017;Tortorellietal.

all attenuation by the mass and metallicity of star forming gas (see
Trayfordetal.2015;Lovelletal.2019;Vƒ≥ayanetal.2021;Pallottini
etal.2022).Despitethisflexibilityintheforwardmodel,achievinga
match to observations has still proven exceedingly difficult. Optical
luminosity functions, well constrained observationally in the local
(ùëß‚àº0.1) Universe, have been reproduced with varying success, and
accurate colour distributions have proven to be even more elusive;

2024).
Despite these difficulties, a few recent works have forward mod-
elled observed galaxy properties from hydrodynamic simulations
and used these within an SBI framework. Recently, Choustikov
et al. (2024) forward modelled JWST NIRCam photometry from
the Sphinx simulations to estimate the ionising emissivity of high-
redshiftgalaxies.Ofparticularrelevanceforthisstudyistheworkof

ofover14000cosmologicalhydrodynamicand ùëÅ-bodysimulations,
designed to explore the effect of cosmological and astrophysical
parameter choices on structure formation and galaxy evolution, par-
ticularly through their use within machine learning frameworks. In
thisprojectweusethehydrodynamicsimulationsfromfourdifferent

Gadgetcode. The addition of Astrid to the CAMELS suite is de-
scribed in (Ni et al. 2023), including details of modifications com-
pared to the fiducial Astrid model.

withina periodicvolume of (25‚Ñé‚àí1)3Mpc3.The initialconditions
for each simulation were generated using second order Lagrangian
perturbation theory using MUSIC(Hahn & Abel 2011), assuming
the same initial power spectrum of gas and dark matter particles at
ùëß=127. In all simulations a number of parameters are kept fixed,
such asŒ©b=0.049,‚Ñé=0.6711,ùëõùë†=0.9624,ùëÄùúà=0.0 eV,
ùë§=‚àí1,Œ©ùêæ=0. The differences between simulations are in the
initial random phases, as well as 4 astrophysical parameters ( ùê¥SN1,
ùê¥SN2,ùê¥AGN1,ùê¥AGN2)and2cosmologicalparameters( Œ©m,ùúé8).We
stressthat,duetodifferencesinthesubgridmodelimplementations,
the astrophysical parameters in each suite have different meanings.
This is true even in the case where two simulations vary the same
quantity(e.g.thewindspeed),becauseofthepreciseimplementation
details, but also because different models hold different secondary
parameters constant whilst varying this primary variable. The phys-
ical meaning of each parameter in each galaxy formation model is
described in Table 1.

the total stellar mass is >108M‚äô(corresponding to at least 5 star

ofthestarformationhistorycanhavealargeimpactontheresulting
emission, particularly in the UV (Trayford et al. 2015). We will
explore methods for smoothing the recent star formation in future
work. In this work we extract the age and metallicity of each star
particle in each subhalo, and model the emission from each star
particle independently (described in Section 3).
There are a number of different simulation sets within each
CAMELS suite. The Cosmic Variance (CV) set contains 27 simula-
tions with identical (fiducial) parameters, only changing the initial

simulations where the 6 parameters are varied using a latin hyper-

ùê¥SN1‚àà [0.25,4.0],ùê¥SN2‚àà [0.5,2.0],ùê¥AGN1‚àà [0.25,4.0], and
ùê¥AGN2‚àà[0.5,2.0]2. The 1 Parameter (1P) set contains 25 simu-
lations where one parameter at a time is varied around the fiducial
parameters. In the 1P and CV sets the fiducial cosmological param-
eters areŒ©m=0.3andùúé8=0.8, and the fiducial astrophysical
parameters are defined at ùê¥=1.0.
The full CAMELS dataset is available online at https://
camels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_access.html ,and
described in Villaescusa-Navarro et al. (2023). We generate pho-

catalogue in Appendix A), and these are also made available online
at the same address.
3 FORWARD MODELLING WITH SYNTHESIZER
In order to model the emission for all galaxies in the CAMELS
simulation suites we employ a forward model for the UV-optical
spectral energy distribution that takes into account stellar emission
andtheimpactofdustattenuation.Importantly,wechooseaforward
model that is agnostic to the specific subgrid implementation in

ensures consistency between the feedback and enrichment subgrid
prescriptions and the forward modelled emission.
Trayford et al. (2015) showed that applying a 3D or 2D aperture
can impact the luminosities of extended, high mass objects, where
up to 40% of the light comes from an extended intracluster compo-
nent. However, we choose to neglect aperture corrections, for three
reasons. Firstly, the low resolution of the fiducial CAMELS simula-
tions,intermsofmass( ‚àº107M‚äôperresolutionelement)andforce
resolution, leads to poorly estimated galaxy sizes. Secondly, since
thevolumeofeachsimulationisrelativelysmall,wedonotsimulate
anymassiveclustersorgroups;assuch,wearenotinamassregime
where aperture corrections are important. And thirdly, the precise
aperture corrections will be strongly dependent on the exact survey
configuration and redshift distribution of sources, a detail we do not
consider in this work. As a result, we choose not to apply any 2D or
3D apertures when estimating photometry.
We do not model the impact of nebular emission from young star
forming regions, nor the contribution of active galactic nuclei; we
leaveanassessmentoftheimpactofthesecomponentsonourresults

3.2 Dust model
Dustconstitutesonlyaround0.1%ofthetotalbaryonsintheUniverse
today, but has an outsize effect on galaxy emission; around 30% of
all photons today have been reprocessed by dust grains (Bernstein
etal.2002).Toaccountfortheeffectofdustinawaythatisagnostic
to the underlying galaxy formation model, we adopt a simple two-
component dust model that differentially attenuates young and old
stars,analogoustothatfirstpresentedbyCharlot&Fall(2000).The
model varies the dust optical depth ùúèas follows,

10 Myr. These parameters were calibrated to nearby galaxies, and
havebeenusedinpreviousstudiesemployingsimilarmodels(Genel

The Cosmic Variance (CV) set contains 27 simulations, each using
the same fiducial parameters, but varying the random seed of the
initial conditions. Figure 2 shows the rest-frame luminosity func-

there are significant differences between the different galaxy forma-
tion models in all bands. Astrid has the lowest normalisation across
the magnitude range in all bands, which matches what is seen for
the galaxy stellar mass function (Ni et al. 2022). Simba extends to
brighter magnitudes in all bands, but most noticeably at the blue
end, where there is almost an order of magnitude more ùëÄFUV‚àº21
galaxies than the other models. This may reflect the slightly higher
normalisationofthegalaxystellasmassfunctionatthehighmassend
in Simba (Dav√© et al. 2019). Both Illustris-TNG and Swift-EAGLE
show similar behaviour in the form and normalisation at all wave-
lengths, but the latter tends to have more faint galaxies in all bands,
by approximately 0.5 dex. Dust attenuation has a more significant
impact on bluer bands, as expected from the form of the attenuation
curve.

tributions in Figure 3, including GALEX FUV‚àíNUVand SDSS

with a more pronounced red population at all wavelengths.
4.1.2 Redshift evolution
We have also generated rest-frame luminosity functions at a range
of redshifts, shown in Figure 4, showing the evolution in abundance
at different wavelengths6. In all galaxy formation models the FUV
LF rises quickly, peaking at ùëß‚àº2, before falling again by ùëß=
0. This corresponds to the evolution in the cosmic star formation
rate density (Madau & Dickinson 2014); more recent star formation
leads to higher UV emission. Interestingly, the shape of the LF also
evolves with redshift in Simba, showing a more pronounced bright

ferent volumes to those in CAMELS, making direct comparisons
difficult.
From these figures it is clear that each parameter has a different
impact depending on the wavelength and galaxy formation model
considered. We first explore the cosmological parameters, before
moving on to the impact of the astrophysical parameters.
4.2.1 Changes in Œ©m
An increase in Œ©mleads to an increase in the overall normalisa-
tion of the halo mass function (Villaescusa-Navarro et al. 2021b),
due to accelerated formation of more massive haloes (McClintock
et al. 2019). However, it has been unclear how this translates into
changes in the LFs beyond the increase in the halo number density,
since the emission is directly dependent on the star formation and
metal enrichment history of each galaxy, which itself depends in a
complicated way on the underlying cosmology (Iyer et al. 2020, , in
prep.).
We see in Figure 5 that increasing Œ©mleads to an increase in the
number of faint galaxies in the optical ( ùëü-band), with little depen-
dence on the galaxy formation model, similar to how it impacts the
galaxystellarmassfunction(Nietal.2023;Lovelletal.2023;Joetal.
2023). We see a similar relationship in the UV, though the relations
are more noisy, which reflects the sensitivity of the UV emission to
star formation on relatively short timescales (last ‚àº100 Myr; Lee
et al. 2009). In general, however, for values of Œ©m> 0.3 the opti-
cal and UV LFs are mostly degenerate, with very little differences
across all magnitudes. The UV and optical ML ratios in Figure 5
help explain this behaviour. Whilst the overall normalisation of the
halo mass function increases with increasing Œ©m, the ML ratio also
increases; galaxies in equal mass haloes are fainter in a universe
with a higher Œ©m. This trend is monotonic for all models, except
Swift-EAGLE, which shows a more complicated evolution for Œ©m=
0.1 (the ML ratio in the UV and optical is much higher in low mass
haloes).
Above a halo mass of 1011M‚äôthere is a general trend across
all simulations and parameters for the ML ratio to decrease with in-
creasingsubhalomass;thisexplainsthecharacteristicschechter-like
shape of the luminosity function in these bands at faint magnitudes

isrelativelyinsensitiveto Œ©m,whichexplainsthelackofcorrelation
of the shape of the LFs with Œ©m(except for in Swift-EAGLE). The
magnitude of the dependence of the ML ratio on Œ©mis also model
dependent;thelargestvariationsatahalomassof 1012M‚äôareseen
in Swift-EAGLE and Astrid, with a difference in the ML ratio in
the UV of|Œ•ùëã|>2. This explains why there is also a significantdecrease in the normalisation at the brightend of the UV LF for the
highestŒ©mvalues in these models.
The colour distributions also tell an interesting story. As Œ©min-
creases,weseereddercolourdistributionsinboththeUVandoptical.
The magnitude of this effect in the optical is largest for the Swift-
EAGLE model; the blue population centred at ùëî‚àíùëü=0.3forŒ©m=
0.1completelydisappearswhen Œ©misincreasedto0.5,leadingtoa
unimodal distribution of red galaxies ( ùëî‚àíùëü‚àº0.8). This behaviour
suggeststhatnotonlyistheabundanceofhaloesandtheirMLratios

Also interesting is that there are less degeneracies between models
withhighŒ©mintheUVandopticalcolourspaces,withcleardiffer-
encesintheircolourdistributionsthroughouttherangeof Œ©mprobed.
This will become important when performing SBI to infer the value
ofŒ©mfrom these distributions, discussed further in Section 5.3.
Sinceahigher Œ©mleadstonotonlyahigherabundanceofhaloes
but also their accelerated formation (McClintock et al. 2019), the
stellar ages in these massive haloes may be generally higher, lead-
ing to the reduced abundance of UV-bright galaxies, and an overall
reddening of their colours. Quiescent fractions have not been stud-
ied in the fiducial Astrid simulation at ùëß=0.1, but in EAGLE they
show a strong correlation with galaxy mass (Furlong et al. 2015), in
agreementwithobservationalconstraintsonthepassivefraction,and
supportingthisnarrative.However,similarbehaviourisalsoseenin
Illustris-TNG (Donnari et al. 2019, 2021; Gabrielpillai et al. 2022)
and Simba (Dav√© et al. 2019; Rodr√≠guez Montero et al. 2019; Ap-
plebyetal.2020).Simbaproducessmootherstarformationhistories

theelevatedrecentSFRsathigher Œ©m,sinceanylong-termvariabil-
itywillhavehadlesstimetoimprintontheoverallSFH(Zhengetal.
2022).
Mergers between haloes and their host galaxies are also more
frequent in a universe with higher Œ©m. Rodr√≠guez Montero et al.
(2019)showedhowmergershaveverylittleeffectonpassivefractions
in Simba, suggesting this effect will have little impact on recent star
formation,andthereforetheUVemission,inthismodel.Dickeyetal.
(2021) showed how passive fractions at low-masses are elevated in
isolated galaxies in EAGLE compared to Illustris-TNG and Simba,
but lower for the most massive objects, which makes it difficult to
pick apart the impact of (recent) mergers in these models.
4.2.2 Changes in ùúé8
The value of ùúé8encodes the degree of matter clustering, and it
has an interesting, and perhaps unexpected, impact on the LFs and
colours. Increasing ùúé8does not have a strong effect on the optical
LFsinallmodels,northeopticalMLratios(exceptasmallincrease
for increasing Œ©min Simba at halo masses ‚àº1012M‚äô). However,
ùúé8does have a discernible effect on the UV LF in some models.
This effect is most pronounced in Simba, where the magnitude of
the brightest object in the UV increases by up to 1.5 magnitudes to
ùëÄFUV=‚àí20forùúé8= 0.6. This can be explained by increases in
the UV ML ratios of up to 0.8 dex in Simba as ùúé8increases, much
greater than any other model.
However, the strongest dependence on ùúé8is seen in the colours;
increasingùúé8tends to lead to redder colours in the UV, but partic-
ularly in the optical ( ùëî‚àíùëü), for all models. In Swift-EAGLE and
Illustris-TNGthismanifestsasarelativeshiftintheheightofthered

Incontrast,inSimbaandAstridthismanifestsasashiftinthepeakof

differenceinhowchangesin ùúé8manifestindifferencesinthecolour
distributions.
Since the emission is wholly dependent on the star formation and
metal enrichment history (SFZH) of our galaxies, we explore how
this SFZH, and its marginal distributions, is dependent on the value
ofùúé8to try and understand these correlations. Figure 7 shows the
normalised star formation history, using the summed ages of all star
particles in each volume, from the Illustris-TNG 1P set changing
ùúé8, further binned by stellar metallicity. It is clear that, for higher
ùúé8, galaxies form earlier, and the aggregate stellar population age is
therefore older. We find a similar trend for the other models. This is
the primary driver of the redder colours seen in Figure 6.
Figure 7 also shows the normalised metallicity distributions as a
function ofùúé8in Illustris-TNG, in bins of stellar age. These show a
moresubtledependenceon ùúé8;greaterclusteringleadstomarginally
higher metallicites, but only in the oldest stellar populations. This
may have a second order impact on the colour distributions, but
the main driver is the stellar ages. A more detailed exploration of
the impact of cosmological and astrophysical parameters on the star
formationandmetalenrichmenthistoriesofgalaxiesinCAMELSis
provided in Iyer et al. in prep..
For largerùúé8, galaxies of all masses will tend to live in denser
environments, closer to massive haloes and filaments, which may
have an additional impact on galaxy colours. Bulichi et al. (2024)
explored how this impacts galaxy properties in the Simba model;
they found that SFRs tend to be reduced with increasing proximity

inEAGLEandIllustris-TNG.Theseeffectsmayexplainthebi-modal

relative impact of changes in ùúé8on the colour distributions.
4.2.3 Changes in supernovae feedback parameters
Theùê¥SN1andùê¥SN2parameters control different elements of the
subgrid star formation feedback models in each galaxy formation
model (see Table 1 for a summary), and as such it is not possible
to compare them directly. Instead we explore each galaxy formation
model in turn, and discuss the impact of each parameter change on
that specific model. Figure 8 show the variation of the LFs, colour
distributions and ML ratios for ùê¥SN1, and Figure 9 shows the same
forùê¥SN2.
InIllustris-TNG, ùê¥SN1controlsthefeedbackenergyperunitSFR
in the form of stellar winds, whereas ùê¥SN2controls the speed of
those winds. Both parameters have a significant impact on the UV
and optical LFs. In the optical, increasing ùê¥SN1tends to lead to a
reduction in the normalisation at all magnitudes, which is reflected
in the increasing normalisation of the ML ratio at all halo masses
with increasing ùê¥SN1. This increase is greatest for haloes with mass
between 1011‚àí1012M‚äô, which reflects the fact that feedback from
stellar winds affects these relatively lower mass haloes more effec-
tively. In the UV, the evolution is more complex; the UV ML ratio
increaseswithincreasing ùê¥SN1atlowhalomasses( <1012M‚äô),but
above this mass limit the relation reverses. This leads to a reduction
inthenormalisationofthefaintendoftheUVLF,butanincreasein
the normalisation at the bright end.
Thisbehaviourmaybeexplainedbythesecondaryeffectofstellar
feedbacksuppressingsupermassiveblackhole(SMBH)growth;Till-man et al. (2023) show how increasing ùê¥SN1leads to a decrease in
theoverallnumberdensityofblackholes,reducingtheglobalimpact
of AGN feedback. This latter effect also has an obvious impact on
the colours, leading to a much bluer distribution in the UV-optical.
It may also reflect that increasing ùê¥SN1leads to greater gas heating,
ratherthanexpellinggasfromhaloes,sothatgasisstillavailablefor
star formation at later times once it has cooled.
Onthecontrary, ùê¥SN2,whichcontrolsthespeedofgalacticwinds,

the overall gas fractions (though the details of baryon spread can
depend in a complex way on feedback parameters, see Gebhardt
etal.2024).Impactsonthegrowthandaccretionontonearbymassive
haloes, containing the brightest galaxies, may also be a secondary
effect. Forùê¥SN2the secondary effects on the black hole number
density are far less prominent.
In Simba,ùê¥SN1controls the mass loading of stellar winds, and
ùê¥SN2controls the wind speed. However, contrary to Illustris-TNG,
increasingthewindspeed( ùê¥SN2)leadsto brightergalaxiesintheUV
forhigherwindspeeds.TheMLratiosreflectthis,showingaturnover
in theùê¥SN1dependence above 1012M‚äô. Gebhardt et al. (2024)
showed how increased wind speed actually leads to reduced baryon
spread, since less gas is available in the central regions for AGN
accretion, which may explain why there is increased star formation
leading to higher UV emission. Tillman et al. (2023) showed that
ùê¥SN2inSimbaalsocurtailsSMBHgrowth,whichwouldcontribute
to the bright end behaviour of the LFs, and also the bluer optical
colour distributions. Also counter intuitively, increasing the mass
loading of winds ( ùê¥SN1) leads to an increasein the number of UV
brightgalaxies,andadecreaseinthelow-massnormalisation,which
is also reflected in the increased fraction of blue galaxies.
In Astrid,ùê¥SN1controls the feedback energy per unit SFR in
stellar winds, and ùê¥SN2the wind speed, both similarly to Illustris-
TNG.ùê¥SN1slightly reduces the faint-end abundance in the optical,
due to increased ML ratios for higher ùê¥SN1below 1012M‚äô. In the
UV it is difficult to discern any clear trends due to the low number
of galaxies, however the UV ML ratios show the opposite trend to
the optical above 1012M‚äô, with higher ML ratios for lower ùê¥SN1.
asntwo has a very strong impact on the global normalisation of the
LF in the UV and optical, leading to a drop of over 1 dex across
all magnitudes. The implementation of the wind speed affects both
highandlowmasshaloes,asclearlyseenintheMLratios,reducing
star formation and the relative abundance across all halo masses.
As a result, the number of galaxies in Astrid that reach the stellar
mass andùëü-band magnitude brightness limits for the colour plots in
Figure9issignificantlyreducedforhigh ùê¥SN2,leadingtoverynoisy
distributions;despitethistheoveralltrendsareforbluerdistributions
at higher feedback parameters.
Finally, in Swift-EAGLE ùê¥SN1controls the energy per unit SNII
feedback event, which drive galactic winds, and ùê¥SN2controls the
metallicity dependence of the feedback fraction per unit mass, ùëõùëç,

powerful feedback at later times, reducing their star formation.
4.2.4 Changes in AGN feedback parameters
As is the case for the supernovae feedback parameters, ùê¥AGN1and
ùê¥AGN2controldifferentelementsofthesubgridAGNfeedbackmod-
elsineachgalaxyformationmodel(seeTable1forasummary),and
cannot be compared directly. Contrary to the supernovae param-
eters, the AGN parameters have a much reduced effect in almost
all the galaxy formation models. This reflects the small box size
in CAMELS ((25‚Ñé‚àí1)3Mpc3) and subsequent lack of (relatively)
massive haloes, as well as SMBH self-regulation.
In Illustris-TNG, ùê¥AGN1controls the kinetic energy released per
unitSMBHaccretionmass,and ùê¥AGN2theejectionspeedandbursti-
nessofthat ejectedmaterial(wheregreaterburstiness leadstomore
frequentbutlowerenergyfeedbackevents;Tillmanetal.2023).How-
ever, neither has any appreciable effect in either the LFs or colour
distributions above and beyond butterfly effects (Genel et al. 2019).
AsimilarstoryunfoldsforSimba;inthismodel ùê¥AGN1controlsthe
momentum in quasar and jet mode feedback, and ùê¥AGN2the speed
of the jet. However, neither has any impact on the LFs and colours.In Astridùê¥AGN1controls energy per unit SMBH accretion, and
thisparticularparameteralsohasnoimpactontheLFsandcolours.
However,ùê¥AGN2,whichcontrolstheenergyinjectedperunitaccre-
tion mass in the thermalfeedback mode, has a large impact on the
LFs, leading to an increase in excess of 1.5 dex at the bright end of
the UV LF, and 1 dex in the optical. Why does increasing this par-
ticular channel of BH feedback lead to increased number densities?
The reason is efficient self-regulation: enhanced thermal feedback
severelysuppressesthegrowthofSMBHs,reducingtheoverallfeed-
backinjected(particularlyinthejetmode),leadingtoenhancedstar
formation(Nietal.2023).Thisalsoleadstobluercoloursinboththe
UV and optical. Another reason why we see a stronger effect from
theAGNparametersinAstridcomparedtoSimbaandIllustris-TNG
is that Astrid has a higher number density of massive black holes in
thefiducialmodel,asevidencedbythe0.5dexhighernormalisation
oftheblackholemassfunctionatthehigh-massend(Nietal.2023).
Finally, in Swift-EAGLE AGN feedback is implemented in a
purely thermal mode; ùê¥AGN1controls the efficiency scaling of the
Bondi accretion rate, and ùê¥AGN2the temperature jump of the gas
during AGN feedback events. Neither parameter has a large effect
on the optical LFs, but there is a small difference in the bright end
in the UV, whereby increasing both parameters reduces the abun-
danceofUVbrightgalaxies.Thedifferencesinthecoloursaremore
pronounced; increasing both parameters lead to redder UV and op-
tical colours. This suggests that increasing the primary efficacy of
thermal feedback in Swift-EAGLE does not lead to the same self-
regulation effects seen in Astrid, and had a more predictable effect
on the luminosities and colours of massive, bright galaxies hosting
AGN.

5 SIMULATION BASED INFERENCE WITH LTU-ILI
We now explore the use of our forward modelled UV-optical lumi-
nosity and colour distributions from the CAMELS LH set within
an SBI framework. SBI is a powerful framework for performing in-
ference in this domain since it permits amortized posteriors, which
significantly speeds up the process of obtaining posteriors. This al-
lowsustoapplythetrainedmodeltohundredsoftestsetsimulations
in just fractions of a second. Additionally, SBI does not require an
explicitlikelihood,whichpermitustousemorecomplexnoisemod-
els, which we will explore in future work when comparing directly
to observations.

fixed learning rate of 5√ó10‚àí4, and an improvement based stopping
criterion.
Throughout the rest of this manuscript we will present models
trained and applied to different simulations. We use the same ar-
chitecture for each trained model. For each simulation we reserve
a subset of the LH simulations as a test set (10%), and a further
subset of the remaining simulations for validation (10%). The re-
maining simulations we use for training, and evaluate our model
performance during training on the validation set. Our priors are set
bythechosendistributionoftheparametersintheLHset,described
inVillaescusa-Navarroetal.(2021b).Aftertraining,toproducepos-
teriors for a given set of parameters we directly take 1000 samples
from the NPE.
For our input data we choose a subset of attenuated luminosity

improve constraints on key cosmological and astrophysical parame-
ters.

highlighting the importance of taking into account such specifics
when marginalising over astrophysics in a cosmological analyses
using such observable features.
As discussed in Sections 4.2.3 & 4.2.4, the feedback parame-
ters are not directly comparable between galaxy formation models.
However, in general, the stellar feedback parameters are all con-
strainedtosomedegreeacrossallmodels.Certainparameters,suchas
ùê¥SN2forIllustris-TNG,arepredictedremarkablywell(RMSE=0.09,
ùëÖ2=0.96), driven by the clear impact on the UV and optical LFs
and colour distributions. In contrast, the AGN parameters are, in
general, not constrained at all, tending to just predict the median
of each distribution. There are some exceptions, such as ùê¥AGN1
for Swift-EAGLE (RMSE=0.54, ùëÖ2=0.66) andùê¥AGN2for Astrid
(RMSE=0.76, ùëÖ2=0.44).Thefactthatthesebothcontrolthethermal
feedback mode suggests that this feedback mode may have more of
an impact on the stellar contents of relatively lower mass haloes,
present in these CAMELS simulation volumes. However, the dis-
cussion in Section 4.2.4 clearly shows how these parameters affect
galaxygrowth,andtheresultantobservables,inoppositedirections;
in Swift-EAGLE, increasing the efficacy of the feedback by dump-
ing more energy inhibits galaxy growth more efficiently, whereas
in Astrid the opposite is true, as increasing the thermal energy per

information in our modelled data (or features) is providing con-

at different redshifts affects our inference, and whether combining

whenprovidingluminosityfunctions(LFs)only,colourdistributions
only, or the combination of LFs and colours. These clearly show
the impact of the different features on the constraints for different
parameters in these specific examples, and the correlations between
the constraints on different parameters in some cases.

of the various features on each parameter. Interestingly, it appears
that LFs do not place tight constraints on Œ©m. The variation with
Œ©mseeninFigure5intheFUVand ùëü-bandismostlyforlowvalues
ofŒ©m(< 0.3); at higher values the differences in the LFs are much
smaller, which introduces large degeneracies, and leads to inflatederror estimates across the test set. Colours, on the other hand, do
leadtoverytightconstraintson Œ©m;thevariationcanbeseenacross
the range of Œ©min Figure 5, which explains the low errors across
the whole test set. For ùúé8it appears that the use of LFs and colours
individually give relatively similar constraints, but combined they
provide much tighter constraints. For ùê¥SN1andùê¥SN2it is a similar
story; comparable constraints for LFs and colours individually, but
tighter constraints combined.
The fact that colours drive the tight constraints on Œ©mis a some-
what surprising result. Jo et al. (2023) show how using just the
binned galaxy stellar mass function can achieve tight constraints on
cosmological and astrophysical parameters, even in the presence of
simulation uncertainty. We do not include the ùêæ-band in this anal-
ysis, which is known to closely trace the underlying stellar mass,
howeveronemightnaivelyexpecttheopticalluminosityfunctionsto
still provide sufficient information on the total stellar mass content.
Thissuggeststhattheimpactofageandmetallicitydegeneraciesmay
play an important role. It also highlights how the colours trace the
stellarageoftheglobalgalaxypopulation,whichcanbesignificantly
higher in a universe with a lower Œ©m(up to 18 Gyr for Œ©m=0.1),

5.3.2 Redshift Dependence
Figure14alsoshowstwoexamplecornerplots(rightcolumn)when
using the combination of the LFs and colours obtained at different
redshifts. In all these examples the marginal posteriors are tighter
when combining information from different redshifts, as expected.
We summarise results from the whole test set in Figure 15, as we
didfortheLFsandcolours.For Œ©m,usingdataat ùëß=0.1hasthemost
constrainingpower,andthisdegradesathigherredshift.However,the
improvement from combining information from the three redshifts
is significant, decreasing the RMSE by >0.01. Interestingly, for ùúé8
themostconstrainingpowerisprovidedbythedistributionfunctions
atùëß=2; this suggests that the impact of matter clustering on the
luminositiesandcoloursofgalaxypopulationsmaybemoreevident
at cosmic noon.
Itisworthnotingthat,intheseexamples,bycombiningsnapshots
at different redshifts we are at risk of using the same galaxies at
different points in their evolution. This may bias our constraints
compared to a real survey, since galaxies at different redshifts along
the lightcone will not be associated in the real Universe, and this
evolution encoded at different times may be more constraining than
independentmeasurements.Inordertoovercomethisissuewecould
subdivideeachsimulationvolumeandtakegalaxiesfromsubboxesat
different redshifts, however for the CAMELS boxes considered here
the volumes are too small to get sufficient statistics. We will more
robustly assess the impact of these correlations in future work with
the larger volume CAMELS-SAM simulations (Perez et al. 2023).
5.4 Generalization Across Different Models
Oneofthemotivationsforincludingmultiplegalaxyformationsim-
ulations in the CAMELS suite was to enable tests of the robustness
of trained machine learning algorithms to different training simu-
lations (de Santi et al. 2023b; Ni et al. 2023). In this case, we can
use the forward modelled photometry from one simulation as input
to our SBI pipeline trained on another, and test the recovery of the
underlyingparameters.Sincetheastrophysicalparametersrepresent

ƒÜiprƒ≥anoviƒá et al. 2020, 2022), which have shown promise in over-
coming these issues when combining models, and for extracting
domain-invariant features, as well as approaches for excluding sig-
nificant outliers (Echeverri-Rojas et al. 2023; de Santi et al. 2023a).
6 DISCUSSION
6.1 Cosmological Constraints
The constraints on cosmological parameters demonstrated in Sec-
tion 5.2 are surprising. By just considering UV-optical luminosity
functions and colours we can obtain precise and accurate estimates
ofŒ©macrossdifferentsubgridgalaxyevolutionmodels.ForIllustris-
TNG,Swift-EAGLEandSimbaweobtainaRMSEacrossthetestset
of0.03,andforAstridslightlyhigherat0.07,whichrepresenthighly
significantconstraints.ThesearetighterthanthoseobtainedbyHahn
et al. (2024) on galaxies from the NASA-Sloan Atlas, despite only
using summary statistics measured on a fraction of the number of
galaxies. In Section 5.3 we show that, in Illustris-TNG, it is pre-
dominantly galaxy colours that drive these significant constraints.
This suggests that it is internalgalaxy properties that are affected
by changes in the matter density, not just the overall abundance of
haloes and therefore galaxies. This is supported by the dependence
of the ML ratios on Œ©m, which implicitly factors out the change in
haloabundance.Thesefindingssomewhatsupportwhatwasfoundin
Villaescusa-Navarro et al. (2022) and Echeverri-Rojas et al. (2023),
wherethepropertiesofasinglegalaxywereusedtoobtainsignificant
constraintson Œ©m.Theconstraintsonmatterclustering,representedbyùúé8, are another surprising result presented in Section 5.2. For all
four simulations we achieve a RMSE ‚©Ω0.09, despite not including
anyspatialinformationinourfeaturesatall.InSection5.3weshow
that it is a combination of galaxy colours and luminosity functions
that drives this good predictive accuracy in Illustris-TNG, which
is in turn driven by the older ages of galaxy stellar populations in
simulations with a higher ùúé8.
We stress that when interpreting these constraints quantitatively
we must keep in mind that this analysis does not include any obser-
vational uncertainties, which will degrade our constraints (see e.g.
Hern√°ndez-Mart√≠nez et al. 2024). We discuss other observational
considerations below. Additionally, we do not include any estimate
of the simulation uncertainty; Jo et al. (2023) show that this can be
derivedfromtheCVsetandusedwithinanemulatortoassessitsim-
pact, and find that it can lead to wider estimated posteriors. Finally,
our dust model does not depend in any way on galaxy properties.
Includingthecorrelationsandcovariancesbetween,forexample,the
massofdustandtheopticaldepth,orthestar-dustgeometryandthe
form of the attenuation curve, will lead to degeneracies with some
of the effects on the LFs and colours seen in Figures 5 and 6, which
will degrade the constraints on cosmological parameters. However,
conversely,thedustmodelitselfmayleakcosmologicalinformation,
duetodependenciesontheSFZHfromeachgalaxy;weexplorethis
effectwithourcurrentgalaxy-independentdustmodelbrieflyinSec-
tion C. We will explore a more sophisticated model that takes these
correlations into account in future work.
6.2 Performing SBI directly on observations
When performing inference in a simulation based inference frame-
work on cosmological parameters in particular, one must take into
account the impact of changing the cosmological parameter on any
forward modelled properties or distribution functions. In this study,
MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì27 (2024)LtU: Parameter inference on photometry 23
where we focus on volume normalised rest-frame distribution func-
tions, this manifests in two main ways; ùêæ-corrections for rest-frame
photometry, and cosmological volume normalisation.
For rest-frame photometry, the change in luminosity distance im-
plied by a change in Œ©mleads to differences in the redshift, and
therefore a change in the rest-frame part of the spectrum probed by
the photometric filter (at a given redshift). In observed catalogues,
theemissionwithinafilterbandpassintherest-frameisestimatedby
assumingaùêæ-correction(Hoggetal.2002).Thiscorrectionassumes
ashapeforthespectrum,whichdependsontheassumedgalaxypop-
ulation, and its evolutionary history. These properties are explicitly
cosmologydependent;ifthecosmologyisupdated,the ùêæ-correction
(or,morespecifically,the ùê∏-correction)mustbeupdatedinlinewith
thiscosmology.InanSBIframework,updatingthetargetobservable
on each parameter iteration is not feasible. Instead, one could for-
ward model into observer-frame fluxes, to avoid the application of a
ùêæ-correction altogether.
Similarly, the change in apparent distance implied by a change
inŒ©malso leads to changes in the differential comoving volume
at a given redshift. This impacts the volume normalisation of any
derivednumbercountdistributions,suchasluminosityfunctions.In
ordertoperformalike-for-likecomparison,itisnecessarytocorrect
for this volume normalisation offset as a function of cosmology.
Alternatively, one can forward model into the observer-frame, and
normalisebytheskyarea,toavoidanydependenceoncosmological
parameters.
In this study we focus on rest-frame ,volume normalised distri-
bution functions, rather than observer frame fluxes. This is to better
understandtheimpactofvariousmodellingassumptionsontherest-
frame properties, and better link to the underlying physics of each
model. We are also limited by the relatively small volume of the
CAMELS simulations, which makes it more difficult to project into
observer-space through the construction of a lightcone.
Finally, whilst observed luminosity functions from SDSS and
GAMA are reasonably well covered in the intermediate magnitude
range over our 1P parameters (see Figures 5 ‚Äì 11), it is clear that
we struggle to reproduce the detailed, complex colour distributions.
Whilst the broad trends are captured, some bins in colour are out
of distribution at this resolution. This is due to the known difficulty
ofreplicatingthedetailedabundanceandcolourdistributionsinob-
servational space, even over this extended parameter space (see e.g.
Trayfordetal.2015).Infutureworkwewillinvestigatetheimpactof
varyingmoreparametersinourforwardmodel,suchasthedustopti-
caldepthandattenuationcurve,toinvestigatewhetherthisincreases
the compatibility of observed colours with the simulations.
For these reasons, we avoid performing inference directly on the
observeddistributionfunctionsintherest-frame,andleaveadetailed
comparison with observations in the observer-frame to future work.
6.3 Forward Modelling Limitations
As touched on briefly in Sections 3 and 2, there are a number of
limitations in our modelling of the emission from galaxies, many of
which are set by the fidelity of the fiducial CAMELS suites. Due to
the low spatial and mass resolution of the hydro simulations we do
notresolvegalaxysizes,whichprecludestheirinclusionasfeatures.
We also therefore cannot include features such as emission profiles,
or resolved maps of the emission in different bands. These features
maycontaincrucialcosmologicalandastrophysicalinformation,and
will be regularly estimated in upcoming wide field surveys, such as
those from Euclid and Rubin.
The mass resolution in particular also places constraints on re-solvedshorttimescalevariationsinthestarformationhistory.These
are important for predicting the recent star formation. which is key
forself-consistentlyproducingthecontributionfromnebularlineand
continuum emission. This recent star formation can be estimated by
smoothing the star formation history, or even by adding small scale
variation through power spectral density methods (Iyer et al. 2020),
however these typically require training from higher resolution in-
put simulations. Finally, the application of detailed dust radiative
transferapproaches,whilstalsolimitedbytheircomputationalcom-
plexity, are also inappropriate for such low-resolution simulations,
sincethestar-dustdistributionwillbepoorlyestimated.Insummary,
whilst the fidelity of the CAMELS simulations is sufficient for an
an analysis of broad band photometric emission in the UV-optical,
higher resolution simulations will be required to explore these more
detailed spatial and time-sensitive features, and for enabling more
sophisticated forward modelling approaches.
7 CONCLUSIONS
We have forward modelled the UV-NIR emission from galaxies
in the CAMELS simulation suites, and used these to perform
Simulation Based Inference (SBI) on galaxy luminosity functions
and colours. All photometric catalogues are made publicly avail-
able at https://camels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_
access.html for the community to use.
Our findings are as follows:
(i) We model luminosity functions and colour distributions in
theGALEXFUV-NUV and SDSS ugrizphotometric bands for the
Swift-EAGLE ,Illustris-TNG ,SimbaandAstridgalaxyformation
models from ùëß=0.1to6, and find significant differences between
theirfiducialpredictions,particularlyintheiropticalandUVcolours.
(ii) Cosmological and astrophysical parameters significantly im-
pact the UV and optical luminosity functions and colours, with the
relative impact depending on the subgrid galaxy formation model.
In particular, we find that Œ©mandùúé8are both correlated with UV-
optical colours, leading to redder galaxy distributions.
(iii) We build an SBI model using the LtU-ILI framework to
predict the values of the cosmological and astrophysical parameters
from our combined luminosity functions and colours, and achieve
relativelyaccurateandpreciseconstraintson Œ©m,ùúé8,ùê¥SN1&ùê¥SN2
acrossallgalaxyformationmodels.TheAGNparametersarepoorly
constrained due to limitations in the CAMELS simulation volumes
restricting the abundance of massive haloes.
(iv) WeperformafeatureimportanceanalysisusingtheIllustris-
TNGmodel,andfindthatthetightconstraintson Œ©maresurprisingly
driven by the UV-optical colour information. Colour information is
similarly important for ùúé8constraints.
(v) We investigate constraints from distribution functions at
higher redshifts, and find that ùúé8is best constrained at cosmic noon
(ùëß=2),ratherthan ùëß=0.1.Thetightestconstraintsforallparameters
are obtained by combining information from multiple redshifts.
(vi) The constraints on ùúé8are surprising given the lack of any
spatial or clustering information in our chosen features. We find
thatenhancedclustering,parametrisedbyhigher ùúé8,leadstoearlier
formingandmoremetalenrichedgalaxies,whichmanifeststhrough
theirstarformationandmetalenrichmenthistories,andsubsequently
their luminosities and colours.
(vii) As a test of robustness we apply a model trained on one
simulationtoanother,andfindpoorgeneralisability,asseeninmany
other CAMELS analyses. We attribute this to differences in the un-

derlying subgrid prescriptions in the galaxy formation models, but
alsoidentifyinflexibilityinourforwardmodelasapotentialculprit.
Theseresultssuggestthatdistributionsofgalaxyluminositiesand
colours across the UV-optical wavelength range contain not only a
wealthofinformationonastrophysicalprocesses,butalsosignificant
cosmological information content. Combined with more traditional
sourcesofcosmologicalinformation,suchasgalaxyclusteringstatis-
tics,thereispotentialtousethesepropertiestoprovidemorestringent
constraints, and potentially break parameter degeneracies between
probes. Calibration of subgrid models in hydrodynamic simulations
of galaxy evolution is also an example where linking parameters to
datainasimulation-drivenBayesianapproachhasadvantages(Elliott
et al. 2021; Jo et al. 2023; Kugel et al. 2023); in this study we show
how this can be done directly in observer space, rather than relying
on inferred physical parameters obtained through SED fitting.
However, we have also shown the sensitivity of our inference to
the underlying galaxy formation model. Whilst we have discussed a
numberofapproachesforovercomingthisinSection5.4,ingeneral
improvedmodelswillhelptoreducethedomainshiftwhenapplying
torealdata.Inaddition,exploringlargerparameterspaceswithmore
physically motivated parameterisations of the astrophysics (e.g. the
28parameterCAMELSSOBOLset;Nietal.2023)willhelptocover
a larger volume of the astrophysical and cosmological parameter
hypervolume.
In addition, the simple forward model for galaxy emission em-
ployed here can also be modified. The fidelity could be increased,
for example by using radiative transfer approaches (Camps & Baes
2015; Narayanan et al. 2021) to self-consistently produce a wider
range of attenuation curves seen in the real Universe (Narayanan
et al. 2018), or alternatively a larger range of parameters in the sim-
ple models employed here could be explored. This is one of the key

pipeline are provided in Section 3.
APPENDIX B: COVERAGE TESTS AND CALIBRATION
We carried out a number of tests of the model coverage for each
of our trained SBI models, in order to calibrate our model (Talts
et al. 2018). In each case we used the 10% of reserved simulation
in the test set. We produced and considered P-P plots, to compare
the CDF of the probability integral transform to that of a uniform
random variable, as well as the posterior predictions directly, to
assesstheaccuracyandprecisionofeachmarginalposterior.Wealso
used approximate methods to test our posterior coverage, including
the Tests of Accuracy with Random Points (Lemos et al. 2023).
TARPevaluatesdistancesbetweensamplesoftheposterior,thetrue
value, and a random point, and uses these to estimate the expected
coverage probability; this approach has been shown to provide a
robust test of the optimality of the posterior estimator. An example
for the Illustris-TNG model (including LFs and colours) is shown in
Figure 1, showing excellent coverage and little to no bias. Similar
results are achieved across all of our trained models.
APPENDIX C: CONSTRAINTS FROM THE INTRINSIC
EMISSION
The dust model described in Section 3.2 does not depend on galaxy
properties explicitly. However, it does attenuate young stars (< 10
Myr) more than old stars, and as such it depends on the shape of
the star formation history of each galaxy around this pivot point.

is no difference in the RMSE, however for the supernovae feedback
parameters the constraints are slightly tighter in the model using
attenuated emission compared to the intrinsic emission. This effect,

stars imprints additional information from the feedback parameters
on the emission, from which the model can learn.
APPENDIX D: FEATURE IMPORTANCE ACROSS
ADDITIONAL MODELS
Figures B1, D1 and D2 show the stacked binned residuals of the
marginal posteriors for the cosmological and supernovae feedback
parameters in the Simba,Swift-EAGLE andAstridsimulations.
Similarly to the trends seen in Figure 15 for Illustris-TNG , we
find that for all simulations it is the colours that provide the most
informationon Œ©m.Wealsoseethattheinformationat ùëß=2ismost
informative for constraints on ùúé8, as compared to lower redshift
luminosity functions and colours.
