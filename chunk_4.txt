Figure 2 shows the rest-frame luminosity func- tion (LF) from all 27 CV set simulations combined, for each galaxy formationmodelat 𝑧=0.1.EachLFisnormalisedbythetotalcom- bined volume of the simulations ( 27×(25ℎ−1)3Mpc3).

Astrid has the lowest normalisation across the magnitude range in all bands, which matches what is seen for the galaxy stellar mass function (Ni et al. 2022). Simba extends to brighter magnitudes in all bands, but most noticeably at the blue end, where there is almost an order of magnitude more 𝑀FUV∼21 galaxies than the other models. This may reflect the slightly higher normalisationofthegalaxystellasmassfunctionatthehighmassend in Simba (Davé et al. 2019). Both Illustris-TNG and Swift-EAGLE show similar behaviour in the form and normalisation at all wave- lengths, but the latter tends to have more faint galaxies in all bands, by approximately 0.5 dex. Dust attenuation has a more significant impact on bluer bands, as expected from the form of the attenuation curve. We also show a number of UV-optical (normalised) colour dis- tributions in Figure 3, including GALEX FUV−NUVand SDSS 𝑔−𝑟,𝑟−𝑖and𝑖−𝑧. These include all galaxies above our fiducial stellar mass limit of 108M⊙, as well as a further cut to remove faint galaxies below an 𝑟-band magnitude limit of 𝑀r<−20.

Astrid and Simba show similar colour distributions at all wavelengths,withasinglestrongpeakinalldistributionsthatcorre- spondstoapredominantlybluestarformingpopulation.Conversely, Swift-EAGLE and Illustris-TNG show more bimodal distributions, with a more pronounced red population at all wavelengths. 4.1.2 Redshift evolution We have also generated rest-frame luminosity functions at a range of redshifts, shown in Figure 4, showing the evolution in abundance at different wavelengths6. In all galaxy formation models the FUV LF rises quickly, peaking at 𝑧∼2, before falling again by 𝑧= 0. This corresponds to the evolution in the cosmic star formation rate density (Madau & Dickinson 2014); more recent star formation leads to higher UV emission. Interestingly, the shape of the LF also evolves with redshift in Simba, showing a more pronounced bright 6Westressthattheserest-frameluminosityfunctionsathigherredshiftcan- notbedirectlycomparedtoobservationswithoutaccountingforthenecessary 𝐾-corrections.

Westressthattheseobservationallyderivedrest–framerelationsare notdirectlycomparabletotheresultsfromCAMELSpresentedhere, for reasons described in depth in Section 6.2; here we just mention that these observations are necessarily 𝐾-corrected, and cover dif- ferent volumes to those in CAMELS, making direct comparisons difficult. From these figures it is clear that each parameter has a different impact depending on the wavelength and galaxy formation model considered. We first explore the cosmological parameters, before moving on to the impact of the astrophysical parameters. 4.2.1 Changes in Ωm An increase in Ωmleads to an increase in the overall normalisa- tion of the halo mass function (Villaescusa-Navarro et al. 2021b), due to accelerated formation of more massive haloes (McClintock et al. 2019). However, it has been unclear how this translates into changes in the LFs beyond the increase in the halo number density, since the emission is directly dependent on the star formation and metal enrichment history of each galaxy, which itself depends in a complicated way on the underlying cosmology (Iyer et al. 2020, , in prep.). We see in Figure 5 that increasing Ωmleads to an increase in the number of faint galaxies in the optical ( 𝑟-band), with
