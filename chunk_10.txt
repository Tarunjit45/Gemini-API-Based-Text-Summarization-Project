and time-sensitive features, and for enabling more sophisticated forward modelling approaches. 7 CONCLUSIONS We have forward modelled the UV-NIR emission from galaxies in the CAMELS simulation suites, and used these to perform Simulation Based Inference (SBI) on galaxy luminosity functions and colours. All photometric catalogues are made publicly avail- able at https://camels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_ access.html for the community to use. Our findings are as follows: (i) We model luminosity functions and colour distributions in theGALEXFUV-NUV and SDSS ugrizphotometric bands for the Swift-EAGLE ,Illustris-TNG ,SimbaandAstridgalaxyformation models from ùëß=0.1to6, and find significant differences between theirfiducialpredictions,particularlyintheiropticalandUVcolours. (ii) Cosmological and astrophysical parameters significantly im- pact the UV and optical luminosity functions and colours, with the relative impact depending on the subgrid galaxy formation model. In particular, we find that Œ©mandùúé8are both correlated with UV- optical colours, leading to redder galaxy distributions. (iii) We build an SBI model using the LtU-ILI framework to predict the values of the cosmological and astrophysical parameters from our combined luminosity functions and colours, and achieve relativelyaccurateandpreciseconstraintson Œ©m,ùúé8,ùê¥SN1&ùê¥SN2 acrossallgalaxyformationmodels.TheAGNparametersarepoorly constrained due to limitations in the CAMELS simulation volumes restricting the abundance of massive haloes. (iv) WeperformafeatureimportanceanalysisusingtheIllustris- TNGmodel,andfindthatthetightconstraintson Œ©maresurprisingly driven by the UV-optical colour information. Colour information is similarly important for ùúé8constraints. (v) We investigate constraints from distribution functions at higher redshifts, and find that ùúé8is best constrained at cosmic noon (ùëß=2),ratherthan ùëß=0.1.Thetightestconstraintsforallparameters are obtained by combining information from multiple redshifts. (vi) The constraints on ùúé8are surprising given the lack of any spatial or clustering information in our chosen features. We find thatenhancedclustering,parametrisedbyhigher ùúé8,leadstoearlier formingandmoremetalenrichedgalaxies,whichmanifeststhrough theirstarformationandmetalenrichmenthistories,andsubsequently their luminosities and colours. (vii) As a test of robustness we apply a model trained on one simulationtoanother,andfindpoorgeneralisability,asseeninmany other CAMELS analyses. We attribute this to differences in the un- MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì27 (2024)24 C. C. Lovell et al. derlying subgrid prescriptions in the galaxy formation models, but alsoidentifyinflexibilityinourforwardmodelasapotentialculprit. Theseresultssuggestthatdistributionsofgalaxyluminositiesand colours across the UV-optical wavelength range contain not only a wealthofinformationonastrophysicalprocesses,butalsosignificant cosmological information content. Combined with more traditional sourcesofcosmologicalinformation,suchasgalaxyclusteringstatis- tics,thereispotentialtousethesepropertiestoprovidemorestringent constraints, and potentially break parameter degeneracies between probes. Calibration of subgrid models in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy evolution is also an example where linking parameters to datainasimulation-drivenBayesianapproachhasadvantages(Elliott et al. 2021; Jo et al. 2023; Kugel et al. 2023); in this study we show how this can be done directly in observer space, rather than relying on inferred physical parameters obtained through SED fitting. However, we have also shown the sensitivity of our inference to the underlying galaxy formation model. Whilst we have discussed a numberofapproachesforovercomingthisinSection5.4,ingeneral improvedmodelswillhelptoreducethedomainshiftwhenapplying torealdata.Inaddition,exploringlargerparameterspaceswithmore physically motivated parameterisations of the astrophysics (e.g. the 28parameterCAMELSSOBOLset;Nietal.2023)willhelptocover a larger volume of the astrophysical and cosmological parameter hypervolume. In addition, the simple forward model for galaxy emission em- ployed here can also be modified. The fidelity could be increased, for example by using radiative transfer approaches (Camps & Baes 2015; Narayanan et al. 2021) to self-consistently produce a wider range of attenuation curves seen in the real Universe (Narayanan et al. 2018), or alternatively a larger range of parameters in the sim- ple models employed here could be explored.
