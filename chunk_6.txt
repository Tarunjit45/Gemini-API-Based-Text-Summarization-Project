the subgrid star formation feedback models in each galaxy formation model (see Table 1 for a summary), and as such it is not possible to compare them directly. Instead we explore each galaxy formation model in turn, and discuss the impact of each parameter change on that specific model. Figure 8 show the variation of the LFs, colour distributions and ML ratios for 𝐴SN1, and Figure 9 shows the same for𝐴SN2. InIllustris-TNG, 𝐴SN1controlsthefeedbackenergyperunitSFR in the form of stellar winds, whereas 𝐴SN2controls the speed of those winds. Both parameters have a significant impact on the UV and optical LFs. In the optical, increasing 𝐴SN1tends to lead to a reduction in the normalisation at all magnitudes, which is reflected in the increasing normalisation of the ML ratio at all halo masses with increasing 𝐴SN1. This increase is greatest for haloes with mass between 1011−1012M⊙, which reflects the fact that feedback from stellar winds affects these relatively lower mass haloes more effec- tively. In the UV, the evolution is more complex; the UV ML ratio increaseswithincreasing 𝐴SN1atlowhalomasses( <1012M⊙),but above this mass limit the relation reverses. This leads to a reduction inthenormalisationofthefaintendoftheUVLF,butanincreasein the normalisation at the bright end. Thisbehaviourmaybeexplainedbythesecondaryeffectofstellar feedbacksuppressingsupermassiveblackhole(SMBH)growth;Till-man et al. (2023) show how increasing 𝐴SN1leads to a decrease in theoverallnumberdensityofblackholes,reducingtheglobalimpact of AGN feedback. This latter effect also has an obvious impact on the colours, leading to a much bluer distribution in the UV-optical. It may also reflect that increasing 𝐴SN1leads to greater gas heating, ratherthanexpellinggasfromhaloes,sothatgasisstillavailablefor star formation at later times once it has cooled. Onthecontrary, 𝐴SN2,whichcontrolsthespeedofgalacticwinds, hasalargeimpactonthebrightendofeachLF.Thisisreflectedinthe MLratios,wherethereisastrongdependenceon 𝐴SN2inrelatively highermasshaloes( >1012M⊙)Thismayreflectthefactthatgashas beenfullyexpelledfromhaloesbythehigherwindspeeds,reducing the overall gas fractions (though the details of baryon spread can depend in a complex way on feedback parameters, see Gebhardt etal.2024).Impactsonthegrowthandaccretionontonearbymassive haloes, containing the brightest galaxies, may also be a secondary effect. For𝐴SN2the secondary effects on the black hole number density are far less prominent. In Simba,𝐴SN1controls the mass loading of stellar winds, and 𝐴SN2controls the wind speed. However, contrary to Illustris-TNG, increasingthewindspeed( 𝐴SN2)leadsto brightergalaxiesintheUV forhigherwindspeeds.TheMLratiosreflectthis,showingaturnover in the𝐴SN1dependence above 1012M⊙. Gebhardt et al. (2024) showed how increased wind speed actually leads to reduced baryon spread, since less gas is available in the central regions for AGN accretion, which may explain why there is increased star formation leading to higher UV emission. Tillman et al. (2023) showed that 𝐴SN2inSimbaalsocurtailsSMBHgrowth,whichwouldcontribute to the bright end behaviour of the LFs, and also the bluer optical colour distributions. Also counter intuitively, increasing the mass loading of winds ( 𝐴SN1) leads to an increasein the number of UV brightgalaxies,andadecreaseinthelow-massnormalisation,which is also reflected in the increased fraction of blue galaxies. In Astrid,𝐴SN1controls the feedback energy per unit SFR in stellar winds, and 𝐴SN2the wind speed, both similarly to Illustris- TNG.𝐴SN1slightly reduces the faint-end abundance in the optical, due to increased ML ratios for higher 𝐴SN1below 1012M⊙. In the UV it is difficult to discern any clear trends due to the low number of galaxies, however the UV ML ratios show the opposite trend to the optical above 1012M⊙, with higher ML ratios for lower 𝐴SN1. asntwo has a very strong impact on the global normalisation of the LF in the UV and optical, leading to a drop of over 1 dex across all magnitudes. The implementation of the wind speed affects both highandlowmasshaloes,asclearlyseenintheMLratios,reducing star formation and the relative abundance across all halo masses. As a result, the number of galaxies in Astrid that reach the stellar mass and𝑟-band magnitude brightness limits for the colour plots in Figure9issignificantlyreducedforhigh 𝐴SN2,leadingtoverynoisy distributions;despitethistheoveralltrendsareforbluerdistributions at higher feedback parameters. Finally, in Swift-EAGLE 𝐴SN1controls the energy per unit SNII feedback event, which drive galactic winds, and 𝐴SN2controls the metallicity dependence of the feedback fraction per unit mass, 𝑛𝑍, 𝑓th=𝑓th,min+𝑓th,max−𝑓th,min 1+𝑍 0.1𝑍⊙𝑛𝑍𝑛H,birth 𝑛H,0−𝑛𝑛, (7) where𝑓th,maxand𝑓th,minarethe upperandlower limitsof thefeed- back fraction, and the (𝑛H,birth/𝑛H,0)−𝑛𝑛term controls the density dependence of the feedback fraction. Increasing 𝐴SN1leads to an overallreductionintheUVandopticalLFnormalisation.Intheop- tical this is clearly explained by the monotonic relationship between MNRAS 000, 1–27 (2024)12 C. C. Lovell et al.

ML ratio and 𝐴SN1, however in the UV things are more compli- cated, with clear dependencies of UV ML on halo mass that further depend on the value of 𝐴SN1. As for the colours, increasing 𝐴SN1 leadstobluergalaxydistributions;thismayreflectsecondaryeffects on the growth of SMBHs, as discussed previously, or the fact that gas is heated rather than expelled, meaning there is fuel for later star formation. Increasing 𝐴SN2leads to increased ML ratios in the optical and UV, and subsequently reduced normalisation of the LFs atallmagnitudes.Italsoleadstoredderdistributions,whichreflects the fact that galaxies that enrich early are then susceptible to more powerful feedback at later times, reducing their star formation. 4.2.4 Changes in AGN feedback parameters As is the case for the supernovae feedback parameters, 𝐴AGN1and 𝐴AGN2controldifferentelementsofthesubgridAGNfeedbackmod- elsineachgalaxyformationmodel(seeTable1forasummary),and cannot be compared directly. Contrary to the supernovae param- eters, the AGN parameters have a much reduced effect in almost all the galaxy formation models. This reflects the small box size in CAMELS ((25ℎ−1)3Mpc3) and subsequent lack of (relatively) massive haloes, as well as SMBH self-regulation. In Illustris-TNG, 𝐴AGN1controls the kinetic energy released per unitSMBHaccretionmass,and 𝐴AGN2theejectionspeedandbursti- nessofthat ejectedmaterial(wheregreaterburstiness leadstomore frequentbutlowerenergyfeedbackevents;Tillmanetal.2023).How- ever, neither has any appreciable effect in either the LFs or colour distributions above and beyond butterfly effects (Genel et al. 2019). AsimilarstoryunfoldsforSimba;inthismodel 𝐴AGN1controlsthe momentum in quasar and jet mode feedback, and 𝐴AGN2the speed of the jet. However, neither has any impact on the LFs and colours.In Astrid𝐴AGN1controls energy per unit SMBH accretion, and thisparticularparameteralsohasnoimpactontheLFsandcolours. However,𝐴AGN2,whichcontrolstheenergyinjectedperunitaccre- tion mass in the thermalfeedback mode, has a large impact on the LFs, leading to an increase in excess of 1.5 dex at the bright end of the UV LF, and 1 dex in the optical. Why does increasing this par- ticular channel of BH feedback lead to increased number densities? The reason is efficient self-regulation: enhanced thermal feedback severelysuppressesthegrowthofSMBHs,reducingtheoverallfeed- backinjected(particularlyinthejetmode),leadingtoenhancedstar formation(Nietal.2023).Thisalsoleadstobluercoloursinboththe UV and optical. Another reason why we see a stronger effect from theAGNparametersinAstridcomparedtoSimbaandIllustris-TNG is that Astrid has a higher number density of massive black holes in thefiducialmodel,asevidencedbythe0.5dexhighernormalisation oftheblackholemassfunctionatthehigh-massend(Nietal.2023). Finally, in Swift-EAGLE AGN feedback is implemented in a purely
