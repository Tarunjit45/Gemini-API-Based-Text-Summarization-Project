The full CAMELS dataset is available online at https:// camels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_access.html ,and described in Villaescusa-Navarro et al. (2023). We generate pho- tometry for galaxies in all sets (pipeline described in Section 3, and catalogue in Appendix A), and these are also made available online at the same address. 3 FORWARD MODELLING WITH SYNTHESIZER In order to model the emission for all galaxies in the CAMELS simulation suites we employ a forward model for the UV-optical spectral energy distribution that takes into account stellar emission andtheimpactofdustattenuation.Importantly,wechooseaforward model that is agnostic to the specific subgrid implementation in 2For Astrid, the 𝐴AGN2parameter also ranges from 0.25 to 4.0 MNRAS 000, 1–27 (2024)4 C.

Trayford et al. (2015) showed that applying a 3D or 2D aperture can impact the luminosities of extended, high mass objects, where up to 40% of the light comes from an extended intracluster compo- nent. However, we choose to neglect aperture corrections, for three reasons. Firstly, the low resolution of the fiducial CAMELS simula- tions,intermsofmass( ∼107M⊙perresolutionelement)andforce resolution, leads to poorly estimated galaxy sizes. Secondly, since thevolumeofeachsimulationisrelativelysmall,wedonotsimulate anymassiveclustersorgroups;assuch,wearenotinamassregime where aperture corrections are important. And thirdly, the precise aperture corrections will be strongly dependent on the exact survey configuration and redshift distribution of sources, a detail we do not consider in this work. As a result, we choose not to apply any 2D or 3D apertures when estimating photometry. We do not model the impact of nebular emission from young star forming regions, nor the contribution of active galactic nuclei; we leaveanassessmentoftheimpactofthesecomponentsonourresults to future work. We also ignore the effect of the clumpy intergalactic medium (IGM), since we concentrate on rest-frame bands redward ofLyman-𝛼,andsincethiseffectwillnothavealargeimpactbelow 𝑧∼3.

Figure 1 shows the inte- grated intrinsic emission in the UV-optical wavelength range from an example galaxy taken from one of the Illustris-TNG CV set sim- ulations. 3.2 Dust model Dustconstitutesonlyaround0.1%ofthetotalbaryonsintheUniverse today, but has an outsize effect on galaxy emission; around 30% of all photons today have been reprocessed by dust grains (Bernstein etal.2002).Toaccountfortheeffectofdustinawaythatisagnostic to the underlying galaxy formation model, we adopt a simple two- component dust model that differentially attenuates young and old stars,analogoustothatfirstpresentedbyCharlot&Fall(2000).The model varies the dust optical depth 𝜏as follows, 𝜏=𝜏cloud+𝜏ISM 𝑡⩽𝑡disp (1) 𝜏=𝜏ISM 𝑡 >𝑡 disp (2) where𝜏cloud=0.67,𝜏ISM=0.334and the dispersion time 𝑡disp= 10 Myr. These parameters were calibrated to nearby galaxies, and havebeenusedinpreviousstudiesemployingsimilarmodels(Genel et al. 2014; Trayford et al. 2015). The only property of each galaxy (andbyextensioneachgalaxyformationmodel)thatdirectlyaffects the level of attenuation is the ratio of stellar mass formed before or after𝑡disp. We use a fixed Milky Way attenuation curve (Pei 1992), parametrised using the analytic form of Li et al. (2008). The trans- mission at wavelength 𝜆for a particle with age 𝑡is then given by 𝑇(𝜆,𝑡)=exp −𝜏MW(𝜆) 𝜏MW(𝜆=5500Å) ×(𝜏cloud+𝜏ISM) (3) We do not model thermal re-emission from dust, nor scattering; the 4Assuming a hydrogen density 𝑁cloud H=1.37×1021cm−2and𝑁ISM H= 6.79×1020cm−2,foranextinctioncrosssection 𝐶𝑉 ext=4.86×10−22(Draine 2003), all calculated at visible wavelengths, 𝜆𝑉=5500Å,latter has been shown to contribute negligibly to the galaxy attenua- tion curve (Fischera et al. 2003). In Simba, the properties of dust are predicted self-consistently usinganon-the-flycreation,growthanddestructionmodel(Lietal. 2019);intheinterestsofconsistencywiththeothergalaxyformation models, we ignore these properties, and adopt the model above. In future work we will explore the impact of our assumed dust model, and perform direct inference on these dust parameters, as well as marginalisationovertheeffectofdustincosmologicalinference.We will also explore how to link the attenuation to the properties of the galaxy (e.g. the metallicity of star-forming gas) in a model agnostic way. 3.3 Photometry We generate rest-frame photometry from each of our intrinsic and dust–attenuatedgalaxySEDsinarangeofphotometricfilters.These include the GALEX FUV & NUV bands, top-hat filters centred at 1500Åand 2800Å,SDSS ugriz,UKIRTUKIDSS YJHK,andJohn- sonUBVJbands5.ThesefilterprofilesareshowninFigure1.Wead- ditionallycalculaterest-frameandobserver-framefluxesintheHST ACSF435W,F606W,F775W,F814W,andF850LPbands,theHST WFC3 F098M, F105W, F110W, F125W, F140W and F160W, and JWST NIRCam F070W, F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356WandF444W.Wedonotusethesebandsinthisstudy,butmake thempubliclyavailableforthecommunity.Formally,theluminosity 𝐿in each band 𝑋is defined as so, 𝐿𝑋≡∫∞ 0𝐿𝜈𝑆𝑋(𝜈)𝑑𝜈 ∫∞ 0𝑆𝑋(𝜈)𝑑𝜈, (4) where𝑆𝑋(𝜈)isthetransmissionatagivenfrequencyforband 𝑋.We thenconvertthecalculatedluminositiestoabsoluteABmagnitudes, 𝑀𝑋=−2.5 log 10𝐿𝜈/(erg/s/Hz) 𝑑=10pc −48.6, (5) where𝑑is
