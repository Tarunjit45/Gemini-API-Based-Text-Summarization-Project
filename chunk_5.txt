little depen- dence on the galaxy formation model, similar to how it impacts the galaxystellarmassfunction(Nietal.2023;Lovelletal.2023;Joetal. 2023). We see a similar relationship in the UV, though the relations are more noisy, which reflects the sensitivity of the UV emission to star formation on relatively short timescales (last ∼100 Myr; Lee et al. 2009). In general, however, for values of Ωm> 0.3 the opti- cal and UV LFs are mostly degenerate, with very little differences across all magnitudes. The UV and optical ML ratios in Figure 5 help explain this behaviour. Whilst the overall normalisation of the halo mass function increases with increasing Ωm, the ML ratio also increases; galaxies in equal mass haloes are fainter in a universe with a higher Ωm. This trend is monotonic for all models, except Swift-EAGLE, which shows a more complicated evolution for Ωm= 0.1 (the ML ratio in the UV and optical is much higher in low mass haloes). Above a halo mass of 1011M⊙there is a general trend across all simulations and parameters for the ML ratio to decrease with in- creasingsubhalomass;thisexplainsthecharacteristicschechter-like shape of the luminosity function in these bands at faint magnitudes (Bullock&Boylan-Kolchin2017).Themassatwhichthisfalloccurs isrelativelyinsensitiveto Ωm,whichexplainsthelackofcorrelation of the shape of the LFs with Ωm(except for in Swift-EAGLE). The magnitude of the dependence of the ML ratio on Ωmis also model dependent;thelargestvariationsatahalomassof 1012M⊙areseen in Swift-EAGLE and Astrid, with a difference in the ML ratio in the UV of|Υ𝑋|>2. This explains why there is also a significantdecrease in the normalisation at the brightend of the UV LF for the highestΩmvalues in these models. The colour distributions also tell an interesting story. As Ωmin- creases,weseereddercolourdistributionsinboththeUVandoptical. The magnitude of this effect in the optical is largest for the Swift- EAGLE model; the blue population centred at 𝑔−𝑟=0.3forΩm= 0.1completelydisappearswhen Ωmisincreasedto0.5,leadingtoa unimodal distribution of red galaxies ( 𝑔−𝑟∼0.8). This behaviour suggeststhatnotonlyistheabundanceofhaloesandtheirMLratios changingwith Ωm,butalsothatthiseffectiswavelengthdependent. Also interesting is that there are less degeneracies between models withhighΩmintheUVandopticalcolourspaces,withcleardiffer- encesintheircolourdistributionsthroughouttherangeof Ωmprobed. This will become important when performing SBI to infer the value ofΩmfrom these distributions, discussed further in Section 5.3. Sinceahigher Ωmleadstonotonlyahigherabundanceofhaloes but also their accelerated formation (McClintock et al. 2019), the stellar ages in these massive haloes may be generally higher, lead- ing to the reduced abundance of UV-bright galaxies, and an overall reddening of their colours. Quiescent fractions have not been stud- ied in the fiducial Astrid simulation at 𝑧=0.1, but in EAGLE they show a strong correlation with galaxy mass (Furlong et al. 2015), in agreementwithobservationalconstraintsonthepassivefraction,and supportingthisnarrative.However,similarbehaviourisalsoseenin Illustris-TNG (Donnari et al. 2019, 2021; Gabrielpillai et al. 2022) and Simba (Davé et al. 2019; Rodríguez Montero et al. 2019; Ap- plebyetal.2020).Simbaproducessmootherstarformationhistories that tend to form later (Dickey et al. 2021), which may also explain theelevatedrecentSFRsathigher Ωm,sinceanylong-termvariabil- itywillhavehadlesstimetoimprintontheoverallSFH(Zhengetal. 2022). Mergers between haloes and their host galaxies are also more frequent in a universe with higher Ωm. Rodríguez Montero et al. (2019)showedhowmergershaveverylittleeffectonpassivefractions in Simba, suggesting this effect will have little impact on recent star formation,andthereforetheUVemission,inthismodel.Dickeyetal. (2021) showed how passive fractions at low-masses are elevated in isolated galaxies in EAGLE compared to Illustris-TNG and Simba, but lower for the most massive objects, which makes it difficult to pick apart the impact of (recent) mergers in these models. 4.2.2 Changes in 𝜎8 The value of 𝜎8encodes the degree of matter clustering, and it has an interesting, and perhaps unexpected, impact on the LFs and colours. Increasing 𝜎8does not have a strong effect on the optical LFsinallmodels,northeopticalMLratios(exceptasmallincrease for increasing Ωmin Simba at halo masses ∼1012M⊙). However, 𝜎8does have a discernible effect on the UV LF in some models. This effect is most pronounced in Simba, where the magnitude of the brightest object in the UV increases by up to 1.5 magnitudes to 𝑀FUV=−20for𝜎8= 0.6. This can be explained by increases in the UV ML ratios of up to 0.8 dex in Simba as 𝜎8increases, much greater than any other model. However, the strongest dependence on 𝜎8is seen in the colours; increasing𝜎8tends to lead to redder colours in the UV, but partic- ularly in the optical ( 𝑔−𝑟), for all models. In Swift-EAGLE and Illustris-TNGthismanifestsasarelativeshiftintheheightofthered andbluepopulationsintheirrespectivebimodalcolourdistributions.

MNRAS 000, 1–27 (2024)LtU: Parameter inference on photometry 11 differenceinhowchangesin 𝜎8manifestindifferencesinthecolour distributions. Since the emission is wholly dependent on the star formation and metal enrichment history (SFZH) of our galaxies, we explore how this SFZH, and its marginal distributions, is dependent on the value of𝜎8to try and understand these correlations. Figure 7 shows the normalised star formation history, using the summed ages of all star particles in each volume, from the Illustris-TNG 1P set changing 𝜎8, further binned by stellar metallicity. It is clear that, for higher 𝜎8, galaxies form earlier, and the aggregate stellar population age is therefore older. We find a similar trend for the other models. This is the primary driver of the redder colours seen in Figure 6. Figure 7 also shows the normalised metallicity distributions as a function of𝜎8in Illustris-TNG, in bins of stellar age. These show a moresubtledependenceon 𝜎8;greaterclusteringleadstomarginally higher metallicites, but only in the oldest stellar populations. This may have a second order impact on the colour distributions, but the main driver is the stellar ages. A more detailed exploration of the impact of cosmological and astrophysical parameters on the star formationandmetalenrichmenthistoriesofgalaxiesinCAMELSis provided in Iyer et al. in prep.. For larger𝜎8, galaxies of all masses will tend to live in denser environments, closer to massive haloes and filaments, which may have an additional impact on galaxy colours. Bulichi et al. (2024) explored how this impacts galaxy properties in the Simba model; they found that SFRs tend to be reduced with increasing proximity tomassiveneighbours,thatsatellitesareaffectedmorethancentrals, andthatincreasedshockheatinginlargescalestructuressuchasfila- ments,ratherthantheimpactoffeedback,drivesthesereductionsin SFR.Bulichietal.(2024)alsocomparedtheirresultsforSimbawith EAGLE and Illustris, and found that the trend of SFR with filament proximity is smoother in Simba, compared to a more abrupt change inEAGLEandIllustris-TNG.Theseeffectsmayexplainthebi-modal colourdistributionsseenintheselattermodels,andcontributetothe relative impact of changes in 𝜎8on the colour distributions. 4.2.3 Changes in supernovae feedback parameters The𝐴SN1and𝐴SN2parameters control different elements of
